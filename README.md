### Notes
The main challenge was fixing the errors with the connections because whenever the superhero tab was clicked, NSException came up. This issue helped me dissolve the problem and find the root cause of the error.

### Notes
While building the app, there was a point where the NSException error kept on occurring due to the fact that multiple connections were made to different objects on the storyboard. Old connections were still alive when objects were deleted. This made it difficult to diagnose the problem.
